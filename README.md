# Course Project: Interactive Media Systems
This project was created for the Course "Interactive Media Systems" at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences. This repository contains the documentation of this project as a PDF file, which goes into detail about the implemented code.

The logic game Mastermind was one of the most popular games of the 1970s. Since then, the game concept has been reused and adapted many times in other games. This work documents the attempt to transfer the game principle of Mastermind into a single-player game against a program using an Arduino Starter Kit. The player's goal is to guess a randomly generated four-digit number sequence. To this end, after each guess, the user receives feedback on the correctness of the selected digits and digit positions in the number sequence via LEDs.

## The inspiration: Mastermind
